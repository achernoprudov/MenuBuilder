### Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding SwiftDI as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift:

Swift 5
```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/achernoprudov/MenuBuilder.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```
